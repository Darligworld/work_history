Console
Before you learn about data types and methods, you need to know how to print values to the console.
The console is a tool that developers use to record the output of their JavaScript programs.
The console.log() command is used to print, or log, text to the console. Consider the following example:
console.log("Hello!");
In this example, Hello! is logged to the console. Notice, we denote the end of the line with a semicolon.
Although your code will usually run as intended without a semicolon,
it is best practice to always include one to ensure your code works as expected in situations when it does need one.
You'll see in the next exercise that you can put any data type inside the parentheses to print it to the console.

Data Types
Data types are the building blocks of all languages and essential pieces of any program.
Below are examples of four primitive data types that lay the foundation for all JavaScript programs.
Primitive data types, as their name implies, are the simplest built-in forms of data.
console.log('New York City');
console.log(40.7);
console.log(true);
console.log(null);
In the example above, the computer logs each of the four primitive data types to the console. The types include:
Strings — Any grouping of keyboard characters
(letters, spaces, numbers, or symbols) surrounded by single quotes ('Hello') or double quotes ("World!").
In the example above, 'New York City' is a string.
Numbers — Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 1516, .002, 23.42. In the example above, 40.7 is a number.
Booleans — Either true or false, with no quotations. In the example above, true is a boolean.
Null — Can only be null. It represents the absence of value.
Let's review: a string is any grouping of words, a number's a number, null is the absence of value,
and a boolean is a ghostly Halloween costume. Or no, that's false! It's either true or false.

Math Operators
Don't worry! Math doesn't need to be your strong-suit to learn JavaScript.
However, there are operators you'll need to know to make useful programs.
JavaScript supports the following math operators:
Add: +
Subtract: -
Multiply: *
Divide: /
These all work how you might guess:
console.log(3 + 4); // Equals 7
console.log(5 - 1); // Equals 4
console.log(4 * 2); // Equals 8
console.log(9 / 3); // Equals 3
In the example above, each line uses a different mathematical operator to log a value to the console.

Properties
When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type.
An instance is an individual case (or object) of a data type.
JavaScript will save a new piece of data, like 'Hello', as a string instance in the computer's memory.
Another example, the number 40.7, is stored as an instance of the number data type.
An instance, like the string 'Hello', has additional information attached to it.
For example, every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in it.
You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name:
console.log('Hello'.length);
In the example above, the value saved to the length property is retrieved from the string, 'Hello'.
The program prints 5 to the console, because Hello has five characters in it.

Built-in Methods
While the length of a string is calculated when an instance is created,
a string instance also has methods that calculate new information as needed.
When these built-in methods are called on an instance, they perform actions that generate an output.
Built-in methods are called, or used, by appending an instance with a period,
the name of the method, and opening (() and closing ()) parentheses. Consider the examples below:
console.log('Hello'.toUpperCase()); // 'HELLO'
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); // true
Let's look at each line separately:
On the first line, the .toUpperCase() method is called on the string instance 'Hello'.
The result is logged to the console. This method returns a string in all capital letters: 'HELLO'.
On the second line, the .startsWith() method is called on the string instance "Hey".
This method also accepts the character 'H' as an input between the opening and closing parentheses.
Since the string 'Hey' does start with the letter 'H', the method returns the boolean true.
You can find a list of built-in string methods in the JavaScript documentation.
Developers use documentation as a reference tool. It describes JavaScript's keywords, methods, and syntax.

Libraries
Instance methods, by definition, require that you create an instance before you can use them.
What if you want to call a method without an instance? That's where JavaScript libraries come in.
Libraries contain methods that you can call without creating an instance.
One such collection contains mathematical methods, aptly named the Math library.
Let's see how you call the .random() method from the Math library:
console.log(Math.random()); // random number between 0 and 1
In the example above, we called the .random() method by appending the library name with a period,
the name of the method, and opening (() and closing ()) parentheses. This method returns a random number between 0 and 1.
This code prints a random number between 0 and 1.
To generate a random number between 0 and 50, we could multiply this result by 50, like so:
Math.random() * 50;
The answer in the example above will most likely be a decimal.
To ensure the answer is a whole number, JavaScript provides a built-in method called Math.floor(). Math.floor() takes a decimal number,
and rounds down to the nearest whole number. You can use Math.floor() to round a random number like this:
Math.floor(Math.random() * 50);
In this case:
Math.random generates a random number between 0 and 1.
We then multiply that number by 50, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.
Then, Math.floor rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.

Comments
As we write JavaScript, we can create comments in our code.
Programs do not evaluate comments when you run them. In other words, they exist just for human readers.
Good comments are useful for you and other developers, because they describe what the code does.
There are two types of code comments in JavaScript:
A single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes // preceding a line of JavaScript code.
// The first 5 decimals of pi
console.log('Pi is equal to ' + 3.14159);
A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment.
/*
console.log('All of this code');
console.log('Is commented out');
console.log('And will not be executed);
*/

Review Types and Operators
Let's take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:
Four essential data types in JavaScript include strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
Data is printed, or logged, to the console with console.log().
Four built-in mathematical operators include +, -, *, and /.
JavaScript associates certain properties with different data types.
JavaScript has built-in methods for different data types.
Libraries are collections of methods that can be called without an instance.
You can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.


Variables
Programmers use variables to write code that is easy to understand and repurpose.
Imagine you're writing a weather app. Your thermometer outside reports the temperature in Celsius,
but your goal is to record the temperature in Fahrenheit.
You write a program that takes a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius and calculates the temperature in Fahrenheit.
Once you've done this though, you see the temperature now reads 16 degrees Celsius. To find Fahrenheit again,
you'd need to write a whole new program to convert 16 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit.
That's where variables come in. Variables allow us to assign data to a word and use the word to reference the data.
If the data changes (like degrees Celsius) we can replace the variable's value instead of re-writing the program.
In this lesson you will learn about two ways to declare variables: let and const.

Let's consider the example above:
const, short for constant, is a JavaScript keyword that creates a new variable with a value that cannot change.
myName is the variable's name. Notice that the word has no spaces, and we capitalized the N.
Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called camelCasing, because the capital letters look like the humps on a camel's back.
= is the assignment operator. It assigns the value ('Arya') to the variable (myName).
'Arya' is the value assigned (=) to the variable myName.
After the variable is declared, we can print 'Arya' to the console with: console.log(myName).
You can save any data type in a variable. For example, here we save numbers:
const myAge = 11;
console.log(myAge);
// Output: 11
In the example above, on line 1 the myAge variable is set to 11. Below that, console.log() is used to print 11 to the console.

Create a Variable: let
In the final task of the previous exercise you received the following error:
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
JavaScript threw an error because you assigned a new value to a constant variable. Constant variables, as their name implies,
are constant — you cannot assign them a different value.
Let variables however, can be reassigned.
let meal = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(meal);
meal = 'Tacos';
console.log(meal);
// output: Enchiladas
// output: Tacos
In the example above, the let keyword is used to create the meal variable with the string 'Enchiladas' saved to it.
On line three, the meal variable is changed to store the string 'Tacos'.
You may be wondering, when to use const vs let. In general, only use const if the value saved to a variable does not change in your program.
Undefined
What happens if you create a variable, but don't assign it a value?
JavaScript creates space for this variable in memory and sets it to undefined. Undefined is the fifth and final primitive data type.
JavaScript assigns the undefined data type to variables that are not assigned a value.
let whatAmI;
In the example above, we created the variable whatAmI without any value assigned to it.
JavaScript creates the variable and sets it equal to the value undefined.

Mathematical Assignment Operators
In this exercise, let's consider how we can use variables and math operators to calculate new values and assign them to a variable.
Check out the example below:
let x = 4;
x = x + 1;
In the example above, we created the variable x with the number 4 assigned to it. On the following line, x = x + 1 increases the value of x from 4 to 5.
Notice, on line two in the example above, to increment x by one we had to write the x variable on the left and right side of the assignment operator (=).
Using a variable twice in one expression is redundant and confusing.
To address this, JavaScript has a collection of built-in mathematical assignment operators that make it easy to calculate
a new value and assign it to the same variable without writing the variable twice. See examples of these operators below.
let x = 4;
x += 2; // x equals 6

let y = 4;
y -= 2; // y equals 2

let z = 4;
z *= 2; // z equals 8

let r = 4;
r++; // r equals 5

let t = 4;
t--; // t equals 3
In the example above, operators are used to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
Let's consider the first three and last two operators separately:
The first three operators (+=, -=, and *=) perform the mathematical operation of the first operator (+, -, or *) using the number on the right,
then assign the new value to the variable.
The last two operators are the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
These operators are responsible for increasing and decreasing a number variable by one, respectively.

Mathematical Assignment Operators
In this exercise, let's consider how we can use variables and math operators to calculate new values and assign them to a variable.
Check out the example below:
let x = 4;
x = x + 1;
In the example above, we created the variable x with the number 4 assigned to it. On the following line, x = x + 1 increases the value of x from 4 to 5.
Notice, on line two in the example above, to increment x by one we had to write the x variable on the left and right side of the assignment operator (=).

See examples of these operators below.
let x = 4;
x += 2; // x equals 6

let y = 4;
y -= 2; // y equals 2

let z = 4;
z *= 2; // z equals 8

let r = 4;
r++; // r equals 5

let t = 4;
t--; // t equals 3
In the example above, operators are used to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
Let's consider the first three and last two operators separately:
The first three operators (+=, -=, and *=) perform the mathematical operation of the first operator (+, -, or *) using the number on the right,
then assign the new value to the variable.
The last two operators are the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
These operators are responsible for increasing and decreasing a number variable by one, respectively.

String Interpolation
In previous exercises, we assigned strings to variables. Here, you will learn how to insert the content saved to a variable into a string.
The JavaScript term for inserting the data saved to a variable into a string is string interpolation.
The + operator, known until now as the addition operator, is used to interpolate (insert) a string variable into a string, as follows:
let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.');
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'
In the example above, we saved the value 'armadillo' to the myPet variable. On the second line, the + operator is used to combine three strings:
I own a pet, the value saved to myPet, and .. We log the result of this interpolation to the console as:
I own a pet armadillo.

String Interpolation II
In the newest version of JavaScript (ES6) we can insert variables into strings with ease, by doing two things:
Instead of using quotes around the string, use backticks (this key is usually located on the top of your keyboard, left of the 1 key).
Wrap your variable with ${myVariable}, followed by a sentence. No +s necessary.
ES6 string interpolation is easier than the method you used last exercise. With ES6 interpolation we can insert variables directly into our text.
It looks like this:
let myPet = 'armadillo'
console.log(`I own a pet ${myPet}.`)
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'
In the example above, the backticks (`) wrap the entire string. The variable (myPet) is inserted using ${}. The resulting string is:
I own a pet armadillo.

Review Variables
Nice work! This lesson covered a lot of foundational skills that you will often use in your future programming endeavors.
Let's review what we learned:
Variables hold reusable data in a program.
JavaScript will throw an error if you try to reassign const variables.
You can reassign variables that you create with the let keyword.
Unset variables store the primitive data type undefined.
Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
The + operator is used to interpolate (combine) multiple strings.
In JavaScript ES6, backticks (`) and ${} are used to interpolate values into a string.

Introduction to Classes

JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language we can use to model real-world items.
In this lesson, you will learn how to make classes.
Classes are a tool that developers use to quickly produce similar objects.

Take, for example, an object representing a dog named halley.
This dog's name (a key) is "Halley" (a value) and has an age (another key) of 3 (another value).
We create the halley object below:

let halley = {
  _name: 'Halley',
  _behavior: 0,

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  },

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}
Now, imagine you own a dog daycare and want to create a catalog of all the dogs who belong to the daycare.
Instead of using the syntax above for every dog that joins the daycare, we can create a Dog class that serves as a template for creating new Dog objects.
For each new dog, you can provide a value for their name.
As you can see, classes are a great way to reduce duplicate code and debugging time.
After we lay the foundation for classes in the first few exercises,
we will introduce inheritance and static methods — two features that will make your code more efficient and meaningful.


                                             Constructor

In the last exercise, you created a class called Dog, and used it to produce a Dog object.
Although you may see similarities between class and object syntax,
there is one important method that sets them apart. It's called the constructor method.
JavaScript calls the constructor() method every time it creates a new instance of a class.

class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.behavior = 0;
  }
}
    Dog is the name of our class. By convention, we capitalize and CamelCase class names.
    JavaScript will invoke the constructor() method every time we create a new instance of our Dog class.
    This constructor() method accepts one argument, name.
    Inside of the constructor() method, we use the this keyword. In the context of a class, this refers to an instance of that class.
    In the Dog class, we use this to set the value of the Dog instance's name property to the name argument.
    Under this.name, we create a property called behavior, which will keep track of the number of times a dog misbehaves.
    The behavior property is always initialized to zero.

                                        Instance
Now, we're ready to create class instances. An instance is an object that contains the property names and methods of a class,
but with unique property values. Let's look at our Dog class example.
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.behavior = 0;
  }
}

const halley = new Dog('Halley'); // Create new Dog instance
console.log(halley.name); // Log the name value saved to halley
// Output: 'Halley'
Below our Dog class, we use the new keyword to create an instance of our Dog class. Let's consider the line of code step-by-step.
    We create a new variable named halley that will store an instance of our Dog class.
    We use the new keyword to generate a new instance of the Dog class. The new keyword calls the constructor(), runs the code inside of it, and then returns the new instance.
    We pass the 'Halley' string to the Dog constructor, which sets the name property to 'Halley'.
    Finally, we log the value saved to the name key in our halley object, which logs 'Halley' to the console.
Now you know how to create instances. In the next exercise, you will learn how to add getters, setters, and methods.

                                        Methods
At this point, we have a Dog class that spins up objects with name and behavior properties.
Below, we will add getters and a method to bring our class to life.
Class method and getter syntax is the same as it is for objects except you can not include
commas between methods.

class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}
In the example above, we add getter methods for name and behavior.
Notice, we also prepended our property names with underscores (_name and _behavior),
which indicate these properties should not be accessed directly.
Under the getters, we add a method named .incrementBehavior().
When you call .incrementBehavior() on a Dog instance, it adds 1 to the _behavior property.
Between each of our methods, we did not include commas.

                             Method Calls
Finally, let's use our new methods to access and manipulate data from Dog instances.
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}
const halley = new Dog('Halley');

In the example above, we create the Dog class, then create an instance,
and save it to a variable named halley.
The syntax for calling methods and getters on an instance is the same as calling them on an
object — append the instance with a period, then the property or method name.
For methods, you must also include opening and closing parentheses.
Let's take a moment to create two Dog instances and call our .incrementBehavior() method on one of them.

let nikko = new Dog('Nikko'); // Create dog named Nikko
nikko.incrementBehavior(); // Add 1 to nikko instance's behavior
let bradford = new Dog('Bradford'); // Create dog name Bradford
console.log(nikko.behavior); // Logs 1 to the console
console.log(bradford.behavior); // Logs 0 to the console

In the example above, we create two new Dog instances, nikko and bradford.
Because we increment the behavior of our nikko instance, but not bradford,
accessing nikko.behavior returns 1 and accessing bradford.behavior returns 0.

                                            Inheritance I
Imagine our doggy daycare is so successful that we decide to expand the business and open a kitty daycare. Before the daycare opens, we need to create a Cat class so we can quickly generate Cat instances.
We know that the properties in our Cat class (name, behavior) are similar to the properties in our Dog class, though, there will be some differences, because of course, cats are not dogs.
Let's say that our Cat class looks like this:

class Cat {
  constructor(name, usesLitter) {
    this._name = name;
    this._usesLitter = usesLitter;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get usesLitter() {
    return this._usesLitter;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}

In the example above, we create a Cat class. It shares a couple of properties (_name and _behavior) and a method (.incrementBehavior()) with the Dog class from earlier exercises.
The Cat class also contains one additional property (_usesLitter), that holds a boolean value to indicate whether a cat can use their litter box.
When multiple classes share properties or methods, they become candidates for inheritance — a tool developers use to decrease the amount of code they need to write.
With inheritance, you can create a parent class (also known as a superclass) with properties and methods that multiple child classes (also known as subclasses) share.
The child classes inherit the properties and methods from their parent class.

Let's abstract the shared properties and methods from our Cat and Dog classes into a parent class called Animal.
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}

In the example above, the Animal class contains the properties and methods that the Cat and Dog classes share (name, behavior, .incrementBehavior()).


                                         Inheritance II
In the last exercise, we created a parent class named Animal for two child classes named Cat and Dog.
The Animal class below contains the shared properties and methods of Cat and Dog.
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}

The code below shows the Cat class that will inherit information from the Animal class.
class Cat {
  constructor(name, usesLitter) {
    this._name = name;
    this._usesLitter = usesLitter;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  get usesLitter() {
    return this._usesLitter;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}
To the right, in main.js, you will put what you learned to practice by creating a parent class named HospitalEmployee.


                                                      Inheritance III
We've abstracted the shared properties and methods of our Cat and Dog classes into a parent class called Animal (See below).
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}

Now that we have these shared properties and methods in the parent Animal class, we can extend them to the subclass, Cat.

class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(name, usesLitter) {
    super(name);
    this._usesLitter = usesLitter;
  }
}
In the example above, we create a new class named Cat that extends the Animal class. Let's pay special attention to our new keywords: extends and super.
    The extends keyword makes the methods of the animal class available inside the cat class.
    The constructor, called when you create a new Cat object, accepts two arguments, name and usesLitter.
    The super keyword calls the constructor of the parent class. In this case, super(name) passes the name argument of the Cat class to the constructor of the Animal class.
    When the Animal constructor runs, it sets this._name = name; for new Cat instances.
    _usesLitter is a new property that is unique to the Cat class, so we set it in the Cat constructor.

Notice, we call super on the first line of our constructor(), then set the usesLitter property on the second line.
In a constructor(), you must always call the super method before you can use the this keyword — if you do not,

JavaScript will throw a reference error. To avoid reference errors, it is best practice to call super on the first line of subclass constructors.
Below, we create a new Cat instance and call its name with the same syntax as we did with the Dog class:

const bryceCat = new Cat('Bryce', false);
console.log(bryceCat._name); // output: Bryce

In the example above, we create a new instance the Cat class, named bryceCat.
We pass it 'Bryce' and false for our name and usesLitter arguments. When we call console.log(bryceCat._name) our program prints, Bryce.
In the example above, we abandoned best practices by calling our _name property directly.
In the next exercise, we'll address this by calling an inherited getter method for our name property.


                                         Inheritance IV

Now that we know how to create an object that inherits properties from a parent class let's turn our attention to methods.
When we call extends in a class declaration, all of the parent methods are available to the child class.
Below, we extend our Animal class to a Cat subclass.

class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(name, usesLitter) {
    super(name);
    this._usesLitter = usesLitter;
  }
}
const bryceCat = new Cat('Bryce', false);

In the example above, our Cat class extends Animal. As a result, the Cat class has access to the Animal getters and the .incrementBehavior() method.
Also in the code above, we create a Cat instance named bryceCat. Because bryceCat has access to the name getter, the code below logs 'Bryce' to the console.
console.log(bryceCat.name);
Since the extends keyword brings all of the parent's getters and methods into the child class,
bryceCat.name accesses the name getter and returns the value saved to the name property.
Now consider a more involved example and try to answer the following question: What will the code below log to the console?
bryceCat.incrementBehavior(); // Call .incrementBehavior() on Cat instance
console.log(bryceCat.behavior); // Log value saved to behavior

The correct answer is 1. But why?
    The Cat class inherits the _behavior property, behavior getter, and the .incrementBehavior() method from the Animal class.
    When we created the bryceCat instance, the Animal constructor set the _behavior property to zero.
    The first line of code calls the inherited .incrementBehavior() method, which increases the bryceCat _behavior value from zero to one.
    The second line of code calls the behavior getter and logs the value saved to _behavior (1).


                                               Inheritance V
In addition to the inherited features, child classes can contain their own properties, getters, setters, and methods.
Below, we will add a usesLitter getter. The syntax for creating getters, setters, and methods is the same as it is in any other class.

class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(name, usesLitter) {
    super(name);
    this._usesLitter = usesLitter;
  }

  get usesLitter() {
    return this._usesLitter;
  }
}

In the example above, we create a usesLitter getter in the Cat class that returns the value saved to _usesLitter.
Compare the Cat class above to the one we created without inheritance:

class Cat {
  constructor(name, usesLitter) {
    this._name = name;
    this._usesLitter = usesLitter;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get usesLitter() {
    return this._usesLitter;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}

We decreased the number of lines required to create the Cat class by about half. Yes, it did require an extra class (Animal),
making the reduction in the size of our Cat class seem moot.
However, the benefits (time saved, readability, efficiency) of inheritance grow as the number and size of your subclasses increase.
One benefit is that when you need to change a method or property that multiple classes share, you can change the parent class, instead of each subclass.
Before we move past inheritance, take a moment to see how we would create an additional subclass, called Dog.

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }
}

This Dog class has access to the same properties, getters, setters, and methods as the Dog class we made without inheritance, and is a quarter the size.
Now that we've abstracted animal daycare features, it's easy to see how you can extend Animal to support other classes, like Rabbit, Bird or even Snake.


Review: Classes

    Classes are templates for objects.
    Javascript calls a constructor method when we create a new instance of a class.
    Inheritance is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes.
    We use the extends keyword to create a subclass.
    The super keyword calls the constructor() of a parent class.
    Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.

    Methods: ES6
In 2015, a new version of JavaScript (ES6) was introduced with additional methods and new syntax. One of the syntax changes impacted how you can create methods.
The new version of JavaScript supports the old method syntax because many JavaScript developers still use it.
The new method syntax (see below) doesn't require arrow syntax or a colon (:) with the function keyword.

const restaurant = {
name: 'Italian Bistro',
seatingCapacity: 120,
hasDineInSpecial: true,
entrees: ['Penne alla Bolognese', 'Chicken Cacciatore', 'Linguine pesto'],

openRestaurant() {
return 'Unlock the door, flip the open sign. We are open for business!';
},
closeRestaurant() {
return 'Lock the door, flip the open sign. We are closed.'
}
In the example above we change the syntax for the .openRestaurant() and .closeRestaurant() methods.
This syntax, which only requires the name of the method and parentheses, is best practice for defining methods.


         The this Keyword I
Objects hold data and functions, which we can use to represent real-world things in JavaScript.
The next step is to create methods that operate on the data inside of the same object.
Let's try it by using the hasDineInSpecial property in the .openRestaurant() method:

const restaurant = {
name: 'Italian Bistro',
seatingCapacity: 120,
hasDineInSpecial: true,
entrees: ['Penne alla Bolognese', 'Chicken Cacciatore', 'Linguine pesto'],
openRestaurant() {
if (hasDineInSpecial) {
return 'Unlock the door, post the special on the board, then flip the open sign.';
} else {
return 'Unlock the door, then flip the open sign.';
}
}
};

console.log(restaurant.openRestaurant());
The output would be:
ReferenceError: hasDineInSpecial is not defined

The error above doesn't work because hasDineInSpecial is out of the .openRestaurant() method's scope.
To address this scope issue, we can use the this keyword to access properties inside of the same object.
We can utilize this in the .openRestaurant() function as such:

const restaurant = {
name: 'Italian Bistro',
seatingCapacity: 120,
hasDineInSpecial: true,
entrees: ['Penne alla Bolognese', 'Chicken Cacciatore', 'Linguine pesto'],
openRestaurant: function() {
if (this.hasDineInSpecial) {
return 'Unlock the door, post the special on the board, then flip the open sign.'
} else {
return 'Unlock the door, then flip the open sign.'
}
}
}

console.log(restaurant.openRestaurant());
The output would be:
Unlock the door, post the special on the board, then flip the open sign.

The .openRestaurant() method in the example above will return a value. The this keyword refers to the current object, which we use to grab the value saved to hasDineInSpecial.
this.hasDineInSpecial inside the object is the same as accessing restaurant.hasDineInSpecial outside the object.


The this Keyword II

In Javascript, this refers to the object we call it inside.

For instance, if we have:

let myObj = {
name: 'Miti',
sayHello() {
return `${this.name} says hello!`;
}
};

If we call myObj.sayHello(), our method will return 'Miti says hello!'.
this in the example above is called inside the myObj object, which limits the scope to the properties inside of myObj.
Let's change that by switching the object calling this:

let yourObj = {
name: 'Timer'
};
yourObj.sayHello = myObj.sayHello;
// Sets the sayHello method on yourObj to be the sayHello method on yourObj

If you call yourObj.sayHello(), it will return 'Timer says hello!'. this in the example above is
called inside the yourObj object, which limits the scope to the properties inside of yourObj.


Getters and Setters I

A common object design paradigm is to include getter and setter methods as attributes.

Getter and setter methods get and set the properties inside of an object. There are a couple of advantages to using these methods for getting and setting properties directly:

You can check if new data is valid before setting a property.
You can perform an action on the data while you are getting or setting a property.
You can control which properties can be set and retrieved.

Let's consider our restaurant object from earlier:

let restaurant = {
name: 'Italian Bistro',
seatingCapacity: 120,
hasDineInSpecial: true,
entrees: ['Penne alla Bolognese', 'Chicken Cacciatore', 'Linguine Pesto']
}

In the example above, the seatingCapacity key holds the number 120. Let's imagine that the restaurant managers like that this value is a number because they can use it to calculate the number of available seats at any given time during the evening.

Available seats = Capacity - Seats Taken

Imagine the restaurant adds an extra room to increase the seating capacity by thirty people and the managers must change the seatingCapacity value in the restaurant object.

A good developer would anticipate seatingCapacity as something that could change. To address this change, they would write code that checks if the newly set seatingCapacity value is valid. For example, the method should check if the seatingCapacity field is a number like 150, not the string 'one hundred fifty'. We can write this into a setter method as follows:

let restaurant = {
_name: 'Italian Bistro',
_seatingCapacity: 120,
_hasDineInSpecial: true,
_entrees: ['Penne alla Bolognese', 'Chicken Cacciatore', 'Linguine pesto'],

set seatingCapacity(newCapacity) {
if (typeof newCapacity === 'number') {
this._seatingCapacity = newCapacity;
console.log(`${newCapacity} is valid input.`);
} else {
console.log(`Change ${newCapacity} to a number.`)
}
}
}

Let's consider the new information in this example step-by-step.

We prepended the property names with underscores (_). Developers use an underscore before a property name to indicate a property or value should not be modified directly by other code. We recommend prepending all properties with an underscore, and creating setters for all attributes you want to access later in your code.
The set seatingCapacity() setter method accepts newCapacity as a variable. The newCapacity variable holds the new value that we will store in _seatingCapacity.
Inside of the .seatingCapacity() setter we use a conditional statement to check if the newCapacity variable (our new value) is a number.
If the input value is a number (valid input), then we use this._seatingCapacity to change the value assigned to _seatingCapacity. If it is not valid, then we output a message to the user.

Getters and Setters II

Now that you know how to create a setter method, you may be wondering how we use it. We call setter methods the same way we edited properties. The example below contains the same object as the last exercise.

let restaurant = {
_name: 'Italian Bistro',
_seatingCapacity: 120,
_hasDineInSpecial: true,
_entrees: ['Penne alla Bolognese', 'Chicken Cacciatore', 'Linguine pesto'],

set seatingCapacity(newCapacity) {
if (typeof newCapacity === 'number') {
this._seatingCapacity = newCapacity;
console.log(`${newCapacity} is valid input.`);
} else {
console.log(`Change ${newCapacity} to a number.`);
}
}

The code below calls the setter method:

// Sets the _seatingCapacity value to 150
restaurant.seatingCapacity = 150;

The output would be:

150 is valid input.

In the example above, we set the _seatingCapacity value to 150. We use the same syntax we would use to set a property that doesn't have a setter method. Since the input (150) is a number, our method will execute the first block in the conditional statement — it changes _seatingCapacity to 150 and logs 150 is a valid input. to the console.


Getters and Setters III

Once you've set the properties, you need a way to access them. Getters are used to get the property values inside of an object.

let restaurant = {
_name: 'Italian Bistro',
_seatingCapacity: 120,
_hasDineInSpecial: true,
_entrees: ['Penne alla Bolognese', 'Chicken Cacciatore', 'Linguine pesto'],

set seatingCapacity(newCapacity) {
if (typeof newCapacity === 'number') {
this._seatingCapacity = newCapacity;
} else {
console.log(`Change ${newCapacity} to a number.`)
}
},

get seatingCapacity() {
console.log(`There are ${this._seatingCapacity} seats at Italian Bistro.`);
return this._seatingCapacity;
}
}

In the example above, the getter method (get seatingCapacity()) logs something to the console and returns the value saved to _seatingCapacity. We call the getter method the same way we would access a property without a method:

restaurant.seatingCapacity = 150;
const seats = restaurant.seatingCapacity;

In this example we set the seatingCapacity to 150, then call the getter method using restaurant.seatingCapacity and save the result to a variable called seats. The getter will also log the following line of code to the console:

There are 150 seats at Italian Bistro.

Review: Objects

Way to go! Let's review what we learned in this lesson:

Objects store key-value pairs and let us represent real-world things in JavaScript.
Properties in objects are separated by commas. Key-value pairs are always separated by a colon.
You can add or edit a property within an object with dot notation.
A method is a function in an object.
this helps us with scope inside of object methods. this is a dynamic variable that can change depending on the object that is calling the method.
Getter and setter methods allow you to process data before accessing or setting property values.

Introduction
You're probably prompted to update your web browser every few months. Do you know why? A few reasons include addressing security vulnerabilities, adding features, and supporting new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.
The reasons above imply there is a period before a software update is released when there are security vulnerabilities and unsupported language syntax.
This lesson focuses on the latter. Specifically, how developers address the gap between the new JavaScript syntax that they use, and the JavaScript syntax that web browsers recognize.
This has become a widespread concern for web developers since Ecma International, the organization responsible for standardizing JavaScript, released a new version of it in 2015, called ECMAScript2015,
commonly referred to as ES6. Note, the 6 refers to the version of JavaScript and is not related to the year it was released (the previous version was ES5).
Upon release, web developers quickly adopted the new ES6 syntax, as it improved readability and efficiency. However, ES6 was not supported by most web browsers, so developers ran into browser compatibility issues.
In this lesson, you will learn about two important tools for addressing browser compatibility issues.
caniuse.com — A website that provides data on web browser compatibility for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features. You will learn how to use it to look up ES6 feature support.
Babel — A Javascript library that you can use to convert new, unsupported JavaScript (ES6), into an older version (ES5) that is recognized by most modern browsers.

                   caniuse.com I
Since Ecma's release of ECMAScript2015 (ES6), software companies have slowly added support for ES6 features and syntax. While most new browser versions support the majority of the ES6 library, there are still a couple sources of compatibility issues:
Some users have not updated to the latest, ES6 supported web browser version.
A few ES6 features, like modules, are still not supported by most web browsers.
Because companies add support for ES6 features gradually, it's important for you to know how to look up browser support on a feature-by-feature basis. The website caniuse.com is the best resource for finding browser compatibility information.
In caniuse, you can enter an ES6 feature, like let, and see the percentage of browsers that recognize it. You can also see when each major web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.) added support for the keyword.

                          Why ES6?
Before we learn how to set up a JavaScript project that converts ES6 to an older version, it's worth understanding a few of the reasons Ecma made such substantial updates.
The version of JavaScript that preceded ES6 is called JavaScript ES5. Three reasons for the ES5 to ES6 updates are listed below:
A similarity to other programming languages — JavaScript ES6 is syntactically more similar to other object-oriented programming languages. This leads to less friction when experienced, non-JavaScript developers want to learn JavaScript.
Readability and economy of code — The new syntax is often easier to understand (more readable) and requires fewer characters to create the same functionality (economy of code).
Addresses sources of ES5 bugs — Some ES5 syntax led to common bugs. With ES6, Ecma introduced syntax that mitigates some of the most common pitfalls.
Because ES6 addressed the above issues, Ecma knew that adoption by web developers would occur quickly, while web browser support lagged behind.
To limit the impact of ES6 browser compatibility issues, Ecma made the new syntax backwards compatible, which means you can map JavaScript ES6 code to ES5.

                 Transpilation With Babel
In the last exercise, you manually converted ES6 code to ES5. Although manual conversion only took you a few minutes, it is unsustainable as the size of the JavaScript file increases.
Because ES6 is predictably backwards compatible, a collection of JavaScript programmers developed a JavaScript library called Babel that transpiles ES6 JavaScript to ES5.
Transpilation is the process of converting one programming language to another.

                 Transpilation With Babel
In the last exercise, you manually converted ES6 code to ES5. Although manual conversion only took you a few minutes, it is unsustainable as the size of the JavaScript file increases.
Because ES6 is predictably backwards compatible, a collection of JavaScript programmers developed a JavaScript library called Babel that transpiles ES6 JavaScript to ES5.
Transpilation is the process of converting one programming language to another.
In the remaining exercises of this lesson, you will learn how to use Babel to transpile the new, easy-to-write version of JavaScript (ES6) to the old, browser-compatible version of JavaScript (ES5).
In the instructions below, you will pass JavaScript ES6 code to Babel, which will transpile it to ES5 and write it to a file in the lib directory.
1.
In the terminal window type:
npm install babel-cli
This installs one of the two required Babel packages.
2.
In the terminal window type:
npm install babel-preset-env
This installs the second of two required Babel packages.
3.
In the terminal, type npm run build and press enter.
You can view the ES5 code in ./lib/main.js.
You may need to refresh to see the newly created lib directory.


                    npm init
In the last exercise, you wrote one command in your terminal to transpile ES6 code to ES5. In the next five exercises you will learn how to setup a JavaScript project that transpiles code when you run npm run build from the root directory of a JavaScript project.
The first step is to place your ES6 JavaScript file in a directory called src. From your root directory, the path to the ES6 file is ./src/main.js
The initial JavaScript project file structure is:
project
|_ src
|___ main.js
Before we install Babel, we need to setup our project to use the node package manager (npm). Developers use npm to access and manage Node packages. Node packages are directories that contain JavaScript code written by other developers. You can use these packages to reduce duplication of work and avoid bugs.
Before we can add Babel to our project directory, we need to run npm init. The npm init command creates a package.json file in the root directory.
A package.json file contains information about the current JavaScript project. Some of this information includes:
Metadata — This includes a project title, description, authors, and more.
A list of node packages required for the project — If another developer wants to run your project, npm looks inside package.json and downloads the packages in this list.
Key-value pairs for command line scripts — You can use npm to run these shorthand scripts to perform some process. In a later exercise, we will add a script that runs Babel and transpiles ES6 to ES5.
If you have Node installed on your computer, you can create a package.json file by typing npm init into the terminal.
The terminal prompts you to fill in fields for the project's metadata (name, description, etc.)
You are not required to answer the prompts, though we recommend at minimum, you add your own title and description. If you don't want to fill in a field, you can press enter. npm will leave fill these fields with default values or leave them empty when it creates the package.json file.
After you run npm init your directory structure will contain the following files and folders:
project
|_ src
|___ main.js
|_ package.json
npm adds the package.json file to the same level as the src directory.


                               Install Node Packages
We use the npm install command to install new Node packages locally. The install command creates a folder called node_modules and copies the package files to it. The install command also installs all of the dependencies for the given package.
To install Babel, we need to npm install two packages, babel-cli and babel-preset-env. However, npm installs over one hundred other packages that are dependencies for Babel to run properly.
We install Babel with the following two commands:
$ npm install babel-cli -D
$ npm install babel-preset-env -D
The babel-cli package includes command line Babel tools, and the babel-preset-env package has the code that maps any JavaScript feature, ES6 and above (ES6+), to ES5.
The -D flag instructs npm to add each package to a property called devDependencies in package.json. Once the project's dependencies are listed in devDependencies, other developers can run your project without installing each package separately. Instead, they can simply run npm install — it instructs npm to look inside package.json and download all of the packages listed in devDependencies.
Once you npm install packages, you can find the Babel packages and all their dependencies in the node_modules folder. The new directory structure contains the following:
project
|_ node_modules
|___ .bin
|___ ...
|_ src
|___ main.js
|_ package.json
The ... in the file structure above is a placeholder for 100+ packages that npm installed.


                    .babelrc
Now that you've downloaded the Babel packages, you need to specify the version of the source JavaScript code.
You can specify the initial JavaScript version inside of a file named .babelrc. In your root directory, you can run touch .babelrc to create this file.
Your project directory contains the following folders and files:
project
|_ node_modules
|___ .bin
|___ ...
|_ src
|___ main.js
|_ .babelrc
|_ package.json

Inside .babelrc you need to define the preset for your source JavaScript file. The preset specifies the version of your initial JavaScript file.
Usually, you want to transpile JavaScript code from versions ES6 and later (ES6+) to ES5. From this point on, we will refer to our source code as ES6+, because Ecma introduces new syntax with each new version of JavaScript.
To specify that we are transpiling code from an ES6+ source, we have to add the following JavaScript object into .babelrc:
{
"presets": ["env"]
}
When you run Babel, it looks in .babelrc to determine the version of the initial JavaScript file. In this case, ["env"] instructs Babel to transpile any code from versions ES6 and later.


                           Babel Source Lib
There's one last step before we can transpile our code. We need to specify a script in package.json that initiates the ES6+ to ES5 transpilation.
Inside of the package.json file, there is a property named "scripts" that holds an object for specifying command line shortcuts. It looks like this:
...
"scripts": {
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
}, ...
In the code above, the "scripts" property contains an object with one property called "test". Below the "test" property, we will add a script that runs Babel like this:
...
"scripts": {
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
"build": "babel src -d lib"
}
In the "scripts" object above, we add a property called "build". The property's value, "babel src -d lib", is a command line method that transpiles ES6+ code to ES5. Let's consider each argument in the method call:
babel — The Babel command call responsible for transpiling code.
src — Instructs Babel to transpile all JavaScript code inside the src directory.
-d — Instructs Babel to write the transpiled code to a directory.
lib — Babel writes the transpiled code to a directory called lib.
In the next exercise, we'll run the babel src -d lib method to transpile our ES6+ code.

                 Build
We're ready to transpile our code! In the last exercise, we wrote the following script in package.json:
"build": "babel src -d lib"
Now, we need to call "build" from the command line to transpile and write ES5 code to a directory called lib.
From the command line, we type:
npm run build
The command above runs the build script in package.json.
Babel writes the ES5 code to a file named main.js (it's always the same name as the original file), inside of a folder called lib. The resulting directory structure is:

project
|_ lib
|___ main.js
|_ node_modules
|___ .bin
|___ ...
|_ src
|___ main.js
|_ .babelrc
|_ package.json
Notice, the directory contains a new folder named lib, with one file, called main.js.
The npm run build command will transpile all JavaScript files inside of the src folder.
This is helpful as you build larger JavaScript projects — regardless of the number of JavaScript files, you only need to run one command (npm run build) to transpile all of your code.

                        Review
In this lesson, you learned about browser compatibility and transpilation. Let's review the key concepts:
ES5 — The old JavaScript version that is supported by all modern web browsers.
ES6 — The new(er) JavaScript version that is not supported by all modern web browsers. The syntax is more readable, similar to other programming languages, and addresses the source of common bugs in ES5.
caniuse.com — a website you can use to look up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript browser compatibility information.
Babel — A JavaScript package that transpiles JavaScript ES6+ code to ES5.
npm init — A terminal command that creates a package.json file.
package.json — A file that contains information about a JavaScript project.
npm install — A command that installs Node packages.
babel-cli — A Node package that contains command line tools for Babel.
babel-preset-env — A Node package that contains ES6+ to ES5 syntax mapping information.
.babelrc — A file that specifies the version of the JavaScript source code.
"build" script — A package.json script that you use to tranpsile ES6+ code to ES5.
npm run build — A command that runs the build script and transpiles ES6+ code to ES5.
For future reference, here is a list of the steps needed to set up a project for transpilation:
Initialize your project using npm init and create a directory called src
Install babel dependencies by running
npm install babel-cli -D
npm install babel-preset-env -D
Create a .babelrc file inside your project and add the following code inside it:

{
"presets": ["env"]
}
Add the following script to your scripts object in package.json:
"build": "babel src -d lib"
Run npm run build whenever you want to transpile your code from your src to lib directories.

Introduction to Functions

A function is a block of code designed to perform a task.
Functions are like recipes. They accept data, perform actions on that data, and return a result.
The beauty of functions is that they allow us to write a block of code once, then we can reuse it over and over without rewriting the same code.
Take a look at the code in this exercise. This code turns the calculator on if it is currently off, and turns it off if the calculator is currently on.
See if you can figure out how this code works. In the next exercise, we'll walk through it line by line.

                                  Functions
How does this code work?
let calculatorIsOn = false;
const pressPowerButton = () => {
  if (calculatorIsOn) {
    console.log('Calculator turning off.');
    calculatorIsOn = false;
  } else {
    console.log('Calculator turning on.');
    calculatorIsOn = true;
  }
};
pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning on.
pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning off.

Let's explore each part in detail.
1. We created a function named pressPowerButton.
const pressPowerButton creates a variable with a given name written in camelCase.
The variable is then set equal = to a set of parentheses followed by an arrow token () =>, indicating the variable stores a function.
This syntax is known as arrow function syntax.
Finally, between the curly braces {} is the function body, or the JavaScript statements that define the function.
This is followed by a semi-colon ;. In JavaScript, any code between curly braces is also known as a block.
2. Inside the function body is an if/else statement.
3. On the last few lines, we call the function by writing its name followed by a semi-colon pressPowerButton();.
This executes the function, running all code within the function body.
4. We executed the code in the function body twice without having to write the same set of instructions twice. Functions can make code reusable!

                                                            Parameters

So far our function has not required any input. We can also write functions that accept data.
We do this with parameters. Parameters are variables in a function definition that represent data we can input into the function.
const multiplyByThirteen = (inputNumber) => {
  console.log(inputNumber * 13);
};

multiplyByThirteen(9);
// Output: 117

Let's explore how this function works:
    We add inputNumber within the parentheses () => of the multiplyByThirteen function. inputNumber is a parameter.
    Inside the multiplyByThirteen() function, we use console.log to print the inputNumber multiplied by 13.
    When we call the multiplyByThirteen() function on the last line, we set the inputNumber parameter. Here, we set it to 9.
    Then, inside the function block, 9 is multiplied by 13, resulting in 117 printing to the console.
    Note on terminology: inputNumber is a parameter, but when we call multiplyByThirteen(9), the 9 is called an argument.
    In other words, arguments are provided when you call a function, and parameters receive arguments as their value.
    When we set the value 9 as the argument, we pass a value to the function.
Parameters let us write logic inside functions that are modified when we call the function. This makes functions more flexible.

                                         Parameters II

If we can set one parameter, can we set two?
We can set as many parameters as we'd like by adding them when we declare the function, separated by commas, like this:
const getAverage = (numberOne, numberTwo) => {
  const average = (numberOne + numberTwo) / 2 ;
  console.log(average);
};
getAverage(365, 27);
// Output: 196

    The getAverage() function has two parameters: numberOne and numberTwo, both entered in the parentheses ().
    When we call the getAverage() function on the last line, we include two numbers as the parameters, also separated by commas.
    In this case, we are telling the function to assign numberOne the value of 365 and numberTwo the value of 27.
    We are passing in 365 and 27 to the getAverage() function.
    When getAverage() runs, the function knows what numberOne and numberTwo equal since we passed in two parameters when we called the function.
   Therefore it evaluates (365 + 27) / 2 and stores the result in the average variable. When logged to the console, the value of the average is 196.
By adding multiple parameters, we can build functions that are more flexible.
Now the function has two variables that we can define when we call the function.

                                                    Return
Using console.log() as the result of a function isn't the best use of a function. The purpose of a function is to take some input,
perform some task on that input, then return a result.
To return a result, we can use the return keyword. Take a look at our function from the last exercise, now re-written slightly:

const getAverage = (numberOne, numberTwo) => {
  const average = (numberOne + numberTwo) / 2;
  return average;
}
console.log(getAverage(365, 27));
// Output: 196

1. Instead of using console.log() inside the getAverage() function, we used the return keyword.
   return will take the value of the variable and return it.
2. On the last line, we called the getAverage() function inside of a console.log() statement, which outputted the result of 196.
3. This code achieved the same output as before, however now our code is better.
   Why? If we wanted to use the getAverage() function in another place in our program, we could without printing the result to the console.
   Using return is generally a best practice when writing functions, as it makes your code more maintainable and flexible.

                                                                Return II

In the last exercise, we pointed out that using return makes programs more maintainable and flexible, but how exactly?
When functions return their value, we can use them together and inside one another.
If our calculator needed to have a Celsius to Fahrenheit operation, we could write it with two functions like so:

const multiplyByNineFifths = (celsius) => {
  return celsius * (9/5);
};
const getFahrenheit = (celsius) => {
  return multiplyByNineFifths(celsius) + 32;
};
console.log('The temperature is ' + getFahrenheit(15) + '°F');
// Output: The temperature is 59°F

Take a look at the getFahrenheit() function. Inside of its block, we called multiplyByNineFifths() and passed it the degrees in celsius.
The multiplyByNineFifths() function multiplied the celsius by (9/5).
Then it returned its value so the getFahrenheit() function could continue on to add 32 to it.
Finally, on the last line, we interpolated the function call within a console.log() statement. This works because getFahrenheit() returns its value.
We can use functions to section off small bits of logic or tasks, then use them when we need to.
Writing functions can help take large and difficult problems and break them into small and manageable problems.

Function Declarations

Now that we have an understanding of functions in JavaScript, let's take a broader look at the type of functions we'll see.
Functions in JavaScript are generally declared as either a function declaration or a function expression.
A function declaration is a function that is bound to an identifier or name.

function square (number) {
  return number * number;
}
console.log(square(5));
// Output: 25.

Function declarations require the keyword function, a name, and a function body.
You can identify this by the use of function square() and the {} below. Function declarations do not end in a semi-colon.


                                           Function Expressions
A function expression is similar to function declaration, with the exception that identifier can be omitted, creating an anonymous function.
Function expressions are often stored in a variable. You can identify a function expression by the absence of
a function name immediately trailing the function keyword.

const square = function (number) {
  return number * number;
};
console.log(square(5));
// Output: 25.
Also note function expressions end with a semi-colon since they are stored in a variable.
In this lesson, we have primarily been using a type of function expression known as an arrow function.
Arrow function syntax is a shorter syntax for a function expression.
You can identify arrow functions through the use of parentheses and the arrow token () =>.

const square = (number) => {
  return number * number;
};

console.log(square(5));
// Output: 25.
It's important to be familiar with the multiple ways of writing functions, since you will come across these in JavaScript code.




                                             Arrow Functions
JavaScript also provides several ways to refactor arrow function syntax. We'll explore a few of these techniques here,
using an example function from a previous exercise.

const multiplyByNineFifths = (celsius) => {
  return celsius * (9/5);
};
const getFahrenheit = (celsius) => {
  return multiplyByNineFifths(celsius) + 32;
};
console.log('The temperature is ' + getFahrenheit(15) + '°F');

We can refactor this function in three ways. The most condensed form of the function is known as concise body.
    Functions that take a single parameter should not use parentheses. The code will still work,
    but it's better practice to omit the parentheses around single parameters. However, if a function takes zero or multiple parameters,
    parentheses are required.
    A function composed of a sole single-line block is automatically returned.
    The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow => and the return keyword can be removed. This is referred to as implicit return.
    A function composed of a sole single-line block does not need brackets.
In other words, the previous code can be refactored like this:
const multiplyByNineFifths = celsius => celsius * (9/5);
const getFahrenheit = celsius => multiplyByNineFifths(celsius) + 32;
console.log('The temperature is ' + getFahrenheit(15) + '°F');
You'll notice:
    The parentheses around celsius have been removed, since it is a single parameter.
    The return keyword has been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.
    The {} have been removed, again, since the function consists of a single-line block.

                          Review Functions
This unit introduced you to functions.
    Functions are written to perform a task.
    Functions take data, perform a set of tasks on the data, and then return the result.
    We can define parameters to be used when calling the function.
    When calling a function, we can pass in arguments, which will set the function's parameters.
    We can use return to return the result of a function which allows us to call functions anywhere, even inside other functions.

    Scope
Scope refers to where a variable can be accessed in a program. While some variables can be accessed from anywhere within a program,
other variables may only be available in a specific context. Scope depends entirely on where a variable is declared.
You can think of scope like the view of the night sky from your window. Everyone who lives on the planet Earth is in the global scope of the stars.
The stars are accessible globally. Meanwhile, if you live in a city, you may see the city skyline or the river.
The skyline and river are only accessible locally in your city, but you can still see the stars that are available globally.
We'll learn more about scope in this lesson through the use of variables.

Introduction to Control Flow
In this lesson, we'll explore how we can use the building blocks of JavaScript to write programs that make decisions.
Control flow statements enable JavaScript programs to make decisions by executing code based on a condition.
If a given condition is true, we execute one block of code. If the statement is false, we execute another block of code.
For instance, if we were making a game in which the user had to choose which door to enter,
we'd need a way for the program to know what to do once the user was in the next room.
In this lesson, we'll learn how to make decisions with JavaScript and how it can control the program's flow

if/else Statements
The core task of programming is writing lists of instructions for computers, or translating our ideas from human-speak to computer-speak.
Let's learn how we can ask JavaScript to think like us and make decisions the way we do.
We'll start with human-speak. Many decisions we make everyday boil down to this sentence in some form:
"If something is true, let's do option 1, or else, if it is false, let's do option 2."
This sentence looks fairly similar when we write it with JavaScript. See for yourself:
let needsCoffee = true;
if (needsCoffee === true) {
    console.log('Finding coffee');
} else {
    console.log('Keep on keeping on!');
}
Lines of code between curly braces are called blocks. if/else statements have two code blocks.
If the variable needsCoffee is true, the program will run the first block of code. Otherwise, it will run the other block of code.
needsCoffee is the condition we are checking inside the if's parentheses. Since it is equal to true,
our program will run the code between the first opening curly brace { (line 2) and the first closing curly brace } (line 4).

                                               True and False Values II
In programming, we often evaluate whether or not an expression is true or truthy. Conveniently, JavaScript provides a shorthand notation for this.
let isRaining = true;
if (isRaining) {
   console.log('Carry an umbrella!');
} else {
  console.log('Enjoy the sun!');
}
