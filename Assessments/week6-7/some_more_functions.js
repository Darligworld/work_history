/**
  Its important that you keep practicing creating functions. Some here are more
  that you will need to implement

  ```

// 1. write a function that takes a string as its first parameter. This function
// counts the number of vowels in the string and returns that number.

// 2. write a function that takes a string as it first parameter. This function
// return a new string with the first 3 letters lower-cased. If the string is less
// than 3 letters long, this function will return the new string with all letters
// upper-cased.

// 3. write a function that stakes a string as it first parameter. This function
// returns the first half of the string if the string is even length. Otherwise,
// it will return null;
